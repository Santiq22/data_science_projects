    "In this project, we will make a convolutional neural network (hereafter CNN) to classify the different astronomical images contained on the [Galaxy Zoo dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge/overview). This set has 61.578 training images and 79.975 test images, which will be used to train and test the deep convolutional classificator. The idea is to analyze the JPG images of galaxies to find automated metrics that reproduce the probability distributions derived from human classifications. For each galaxy, determine the probability that it belongs in a particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In July 2007, astronomers from Oxford University had in their possession a data set of approximately 1 million galaxies imaged by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). But the galaxies in this data set needed to have their morphologies (shapes) classified in order to be used to better understand galactic processes. With so many galaxies, it would have taken an individual a thousand lifetimes to classify all of them. Instead, [Galaxy Zoo was born](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zookeeper/galaxy-zoo/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Galaxy Zoo took an innovative approach that brought astronomy to the general public: log on and help classify a galaxy, driven to a successful citizen science crowdsourcing project.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was initially assumed that despite outsourcing the work to thousands in the general public, it would still take years for all of the images to be classified. Within the first 24 hours of launch, Galaxy Zoo founders were stunned to be receiving nearly 70 000 classifications an hour. In the end, more than 50 million classifications were received by the project during its first year, contributed by more than 150 000 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Galaxy Zoo project has gone through four iterations. The first was focused on deciding if a galaxy was elliptical, spiral (including direction), or a merger of two galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Galaxy Zoo 2* asked for more details on bright SDSS galaxies. These detailed classifications include (amongst others) measurements of the bulge size, presence of bars, and the structure of spiral arms. This is what it is aimed in this project, to construct a machine learning algorithm able to classify a given galaxy based on the classification rules defined in Galaxy Zoo 2. These rules are described in the image below.\n",

    "##### Weighting the responses\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of the morphology categories in the solution file are computed as follows. For the first set of responses (smooth, features/disk, star/artifact), the values in each category are simply the likelihood of the galaxy falling in each category. These values sum to 1.0. For each subsequent question, the probabilities are first computed (these will sum to 1.0) and then multiplied by the value which led to that new set of responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simplified example: a galaxy had 80% of users identify it as smooth, 15% as having features/disk, and 5% as a star/artifact.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Class | Probability of being that class |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| Class1.1 | 0.80 |\n",
    "| Class1.2 | 0.15 |\n",
    "| Class1.3 | 0.05 |\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 80% of users that identified the galaxy as \"smooth\", they also recorded responses for the galaxy's relative roundness. These votes were for 50% completely round, 25% in-between, and 25% cigar-shaped. The values in the solution file are thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Class | Weighted probability of being that class |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| Class 7.1 | 0.80 * 0.50 = 0.40 |\n",
    "| Class 7.2 | 0.80 * 0.25 = 0.20 |\n",
    "| Class 7.3 | 0.80 * 0.25 = 0.20 |\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this weighting is to emphasize that a good solution must get the high-level, large-scale morphology categories correct. The best solutions, though, will also have high levels of accuracy on the detailed solutions that are further down the decision tree."

Each node connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold, as it is shown below.\n",

    "Convolutional neural networks are distinguished from other neural networks by their superior performance with image, speech, or audio signal inputs. They have three main types of layers, which are:\n",
    "- Convolutional layer\n",
    "- Pooling layer\n",
    "- Fully-connected (FC) layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The *convolutional layer* is the first layer of a convolutional network. While convolutional layers can be followed by additional convolutional layers or *pooling layers*, the *fully-connected* layer is the final layer. With each layer, the CNN increases in its complexity, identifying greater portions of the image. Earlier layers focus on simple features, such as colors and edges. As the image data progresses through the layers of the CNN, it starts to recognize larger elements or shapes of the object until it finally identifies the intended object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convolutional layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolutional layer is the core building block of a CNN, and it is where the majority of computation occurs. It requires a few components, which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input data: Since in this projects we are going to work with galaxy images, letâ€™s assume that the input will be a color image. It is made up of a matrix of pixels in 3D, which means that the input will have three dimensions (a height, width, and depth) which correspond to RGB in an image.\n",
    "- Filter: It is the feature detector, also known as a kernel, which will move across the receptive fields of the image, checking if the feature is present. This process is known as a *convolution*. The feature detector is a two-dimensional (2-D) array of weights, which represents part of the image. They can vary in size, which determines the size of the receptive field. The filter is then applied to an area of the image, and a dot product is calculated between the input pixels and the filter. This dot product is then fed into an output array. Afterwards, the filter shifts by a *stride*, repeating the process until the kernel has swept across the entire image.\n",
    "- Feature map: The final output from the series of dot products from the input and the filter is known as a feature map, activation map, or a convolved feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each convolution operation, a CNN applies an activation function transformation to the feature map, introducing nonlinearity to the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned earlier, another convolution layer can follow the initial convolution layer. When this happens, the structure of the CNN can become hierarchical as the later layers can see the pixels within the receptive fields of prior layers.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Pooling layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling layers, also known as downsampling, conducts dimensionality reduction, reducing the number of parameters in the input. Its purpose is to gradually shrink the representationâ€™s spatial dimension. Similar to the convolutional layer, the pooling operation sweeps a filter across the entire input, but the difference is that this filter does not have any weights. Instead, the kernel applies an aggregation function to the values within the receptive field, populating the output array. There are two main types of pooling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Max pooling: As the filter moves across the input, it selects the pixel with the maximum value to send to the output array. As an aside, this approach tends to be used more often compared to average pooling.\n",
    "- Average pooling: As the filter moves across the input, it calculates the average value within the receptive field to send to the output array.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "While a lot of information is lost in the pooling layer, it also has a number of benefits to the CNN. They help to reduce complexity, improve efficiency, and limit risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fully-connected layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The pixel values of the input image are not directly connected to the output layer in partially connected layers. However, in the fully-connected layer, each node in the output layer connects directly to a node in the previous layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of layers perform the task of classification based on the features extracted through the previous layers and their different filters. While convolutional and pooling layers tend to use ReLu functions, for example, fully-connected layers usually leverage a softmax activation function to classify inputs appropriately, producing a probability from 0 to 1. This is what we will use in this project.\n",
